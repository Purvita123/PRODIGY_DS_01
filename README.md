Hey guys!
I recently completed a project on World Population 1960 t0 2022 on Microsoft Power BI where I analyzed the data from different countries and interpreted them using bar chart visualizations and combined them into dashboards.

Data Source link - https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL

Steps involved-
1. Collecting the World Population dataset from Kaggle and connecting it to Microsoft Power BI.
2. Using Power Query Editor to transform the data, change the data types, and convert the columns named 'YEAR' and 'POpulation' into numeric values from string type variables.
3. Developed two interactive dashboards using various charts and graphs with a top 10 filter, including text cards to show aggregate results,  bar charts, slicer and card
